# energy-data-disaggregation

# Abstract
Monitoring of home appliances provides useful information on how to improve user consump-tion habits and refine energy conservation.  This information could also be used in combina-tion  with  other  energy  conservation  software  to  reduce  energy  consumption  overall.   Manyhave  tried  to  measure  the  power  consumption  per  device  using  sub-meters  at  plug  level,  thishowever is impractical and economically infeasible.  In this paper we explore the possibility ofobtaining the state of devices from aggregate power consumption data using neural networks.We will explore an existing method and analyse how well it does on the most frequently presentdevices  in  a  household  and  extend  it  to  take  weather  data  into  account.  In  addition  to  thatwe  will  explore  the  opportunity  of  generalizing  this  implementation  across  houses  by  lettingthe  neural  network  learn  on  a  set  of  household  consumption  data  and  testing  it  on  anotherhousehold
